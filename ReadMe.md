<h1>PostHuman</h1>
<p>>PostHuman lets you use a interface such as PostMan, but only for get requests , while creating your api , The purpose is to repeat the graphql interface, but this time for rest api, for now it only accepts get requets as the purpose is to use more query, the code is pretty simple so it should be to make it accept post request</p>
